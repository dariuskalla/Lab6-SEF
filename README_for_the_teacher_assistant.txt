Hello!

Darius Calapis is writing this to you some honest words. I am sorry for this very late submission of the homework. I tried to make it with Diana Groza in 7th week. I failed back then to do anything because, now looking back, i realized that the fault was on me entireley. Back then i did not understand how to use Git and IntelliJ's VCS properly. So in that evening when me and Diana started working on the project, all the errors and all the failed attempts to make the project made me a bit (more) frustrated and i said i'll make it some other time, after i refresh my mind. Days passed and i forgot for a few moments about it until yesterday. Found out that Danci Denis did not complete this either so we teamed up and finished the project. 

Thank you!

Have a nice day!
